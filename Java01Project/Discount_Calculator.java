/*A video club wants to reward its best members with a discount based on
 the memberâ€™s number of movie rentals and the number of new members referred 
 by the member. The discount is in percent and is equal to the sum of the rentals 
 and the referrals, but it cannot exceed 75 percent. (Hint: Math.min.) Write a program 
 Discount_Calculator to calculate the value of the discount.
