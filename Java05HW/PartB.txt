char c = name.charAt(0);
charAt is an instance method because it calls on the "name" object instead of any class.

String answer = String.valueOf(Math.PI / 2.0);
This is a static method because "String" (capitalized) is a method, or what we called a "blueprint"
in our class discussion.

String msg = String.format("PI = %.5f", Math.PI);
Another static method for the similar reason, it is a method of the String class instead of an object.

int length = phrase.length();
This is an instance method because, like the first one, it calls a "phrase" object instead of a class.
